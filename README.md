# NBA-Analysis

**Inspiration**
Growing up in the Bay Area, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to call the Golden State Warriors my home team. The team in which I supported no matter what, the highs the the lows. Eventually, I developed a love for the game of baskteball and considering I enjoyed Math, I started making NBA data driven content on Youtube. It was fun to say the least. Now, I'm graduating college and kinda know how to play around with data so yeah, I decided to do the following in my spare time.

**About the Project**
In this project, I take a look at the growth of the NBA since 2004. I take a look at the following features for the whole NBA and in addition the same features but team specific as well. The graphs and visuals will help the users get a visual represnetation of the evolution of the NBA through these past couple of years.  

- Points per Game
- Assists per Game
- Rebounds per Game
- Fouls per Game
- Shots per Game
